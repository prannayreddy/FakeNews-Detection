# Fake News Detection
Published in JARDCS (Scopus-indexed Journal)  http://jardcs.org/abstract.php?id=1387
The proliferation of misleading information in everyday access media outlets such as social media feeds, news blogs, and online newspapers have made it challenging to identify trustworthy news sources, thus increasing the need for computational tools able to provide insights into the reliability of online content. We focus on fake news detection exploring the applications of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Learning techniques are used to identify fake news accurately. Pre-processing tools are used to clean the data and apply feature extraction on them. Then a fake news detection model is built using four different techniques, Naïve Bayes, SVM, Neural Networks and LSTM. We investigate and compare the accuracy of the techniques to find out the best fit technique for the model.
